## How do you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

### In order to write programs and code that are maintainable, readable and adaptable I try to conform to the naming and clean code conventions set by each language and their community. For example in python i make sure to name methods using underscores to separate words whereas in java i would elect to use camel casing for naming methods. I would also stick to certain methodologies that I have learned to improve the quality of code such as giving method names that are self explanatory to its purpose and keeping nested code to a maximum of 3 levels to improve upon the readability of my code.
